	  <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>What are you passionate about?</b> </p>
 <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>What kind of IT innovation would you like to see?</b> </p>
  <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to make you qualified for your ideal job?</b> </p>

 <p class="w3-text-grey">I really enjoy gaming, I’m passionate about it. I like the complexities they can entail and choices that players can have. The ability to tell a story that has many different forks and options for a player. While visual fidelity is good I'm much more interested in the actual mechanics of a video game and how they engage with a player. Be able to create something that doesn't appear linear in its function to a player but to a developer has to due to the nature or code. That has a replayability and different options that other media cant really achieve.</p>

 <p class="w3-text-grey">Id really like to focus on game developing, creating something distinct. Not necessarily cutting edge graphically but something that could stand out and be interesting. Even though video game creation seems to be the most accessible it has ever been with free software such as unity and unreal and online stores such as steam and unreal it may be hard to stand out. Even to innovate could be hard, as just based on pure numbers something similar could already exist and also to stand out from the crowd would be difficult. My first focus would be I'd want the video game to firstly be able to work as a good piece of software so testing and removal and fixing any bugs would be very important to learn and do during the process.</p>

 <p class="w3-text-grey">I believe focusing on a project within a game engine perhaps either in the unreal engine or unity 3d as they seem to be the industry standard at the moment and also there are free version available to download and learn. Focusing on one or both of these would be good because a lot of work seems to want a skill set that knows how to utilise both those engines. On the other hand I may need to concentrate on just one of the engines to I can understand it the best, could possible limit my scope of work as I only know one engine well but on the positive side the engine that I did learn I would understand thoroughly than if I had to split my time. Either way learning either must be needed for a prospective game developer. Also I depending on what engine I learn I will need to learn either C++ for unreal or C# for unity to be able to utilise there scripting system.</p>
