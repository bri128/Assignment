      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Personal information / contact information   </p>
	  
	  <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>Name:</B> Brian Ward</P>
<p class="w3-text-grey"><b>Student number:</b> S3833247</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey"><b>Email: </b>S3833247@student.rmit.edu.au </P>

<p class="w3-text-grey">I’m an Australian and the highest education I achieved was a diploma I finished in a different industry. I like football/soccer and like to watch the English Premier league and I’m a sufferng Arsenal FC fan.</P>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Personal Profile ( 3 tests results )</p>

<p class="w3-text-grey"> <b>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test: </b></p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">My type is the INTJ
As an INTJ, I tend to be confident, analytical, and ambitious. I'm likely an independent thinker focused on solving the worlds’ problems.</p>

<p class="w3-text-grey"> <b> The results of an online learning style test. </b></p>
<p class="w3-text-grey"> Score:</p>

    <p class="w3-text-grey">• Auditory: 25%</p>
   <p class="w3-text-grey"> • Visual: 55%</p>
   <p class="w3-text-grey"> • Tactile: 20%</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">I'm a Visual learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.</p>

<p class="w3-text-grey">Visual</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:</p>
   <p class="w3-text-grey"> • Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!) </p>
   <p class="w3-text-grey"> • Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis. </p>
   <p class="w3-text-grey"> • Use flashcards to learn new words. </p>
   <p class="w3-text-grey"> • Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you. </p>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">• Write down key words, ideas, or instructions. </p>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">• Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures. </p>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">• Color code things. </p>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">• Avoid distractions during study times. </p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.</p>


<p class="w3-text-grey"> <b>  The results of one further online test of your choosing: </b> </p>
<p class="w3-text-grey"> Verbal Reasoning</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey"> Verbal reasoning tests are used by interviewers to find out how well a candidate can assess verbal logic. The practice test I picked simple ranked me as either fail or pass </p>
<p class="w3-text-grey"> My result Verbal Reasoning Practice Test was a <b>Pass</b></p>

<p class="w3-text-grey"> <b> What do the results of these tests mean for you? </b> </p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">These tests could be used for me to identify best ways I learn and also other areas where I may need to work on. I can hopefully use this information to try to learn things easier using visual guides and  instructions thanks to the test.</p>

<p class="w3-text-grey"> <b> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </b> </p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">Apparently I am a intj which is an independent thinker so I should try to make myself more adaptive within a team environment perhaps when I’m in one. I should be aware of this and try to make a better effort for team work related tasks for example especially for something like assignment 2.</p>




<p class="w3-text-grey"> <b> How should you take this into account when forming a team? </b> </p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">Its good to have an idea of everyone's learning style and whatever other strengths and weakness we all bring to the table. If we cant be strong in all areas we know which areas we may need to prepare extra focus on.  Having an idea of what may be our character types and learning style we may be able to find common ground easier to make teamwork more effective.</p>
